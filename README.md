# VIRTTRUHE
## Experimental game to explore the border between physical and virtual space. A playground for augmented reality (or maybe augmented virtuality)

(insert fancy image here)

This repository is in sequel to the old ["VIRTTRUHE HTML5 App"](https://github.com/gitbreaker222/virttruhe_html5_app), to give it a clean start and making it more scalable.

## Getting started

As long as there is no installer script, you need to:
 - install the dependencies for the build task (1)
 - run the the build task (2)
 - run the index.html from the new app folder (3)

 ### 1: installing dependecies

 I think this can be done from project directory via terminal with:
 ```
 npm install (something to be found out)
 ```
 It should create a folder _node_modules_ with the packages listed in _package.json_. At the time of writing:
 ```json
 "devDependencies": {
     "coffee-script": "^1.10.0",
     "del": "^2.2.0",
     "gulp": "^3.9.1",
     "gulp-coffee": "^2.3.2",
     "gulp-jade": "^1.1.0",
     "gulp-sass": "^2.2.0",
     "gulp-util": "^3.0.7",
     "jade": "^1.11.0",
     "run-sequence": "^1.1.5",
     "sass": "^0.5.0"
   }
 ```

 ### 2: run the build task

 Run ```gulp``` in the terminal to trigger the _gulp default_ task. An IDE like Webstorm shows these tasks usually on the left. You can also run the _default_ task from there.

  A new folder **app** will be created with all compiled files from **src_app**.

 ### 3: run index.html

 In the new folder its best to use an IDE to lauch the _index.html_, so it runs in a webserver.
