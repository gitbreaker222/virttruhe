# VIRTTRUHE
## Experimental game to explore the border between physical and virtual space. A playground for augmented reality (or maybe augmented virtuality)

(insert fancy image here)

This repository is in sequel to the old ["VIRTTRUHE HTML5 App"](https://github.com/gitbreaker222/virttruhe_html5_app), to give it a clean start and making it more scalable.

## Starting the app

[Click here to view the online demo](https://rawgit.com/gitbreaker222/virttruhe/master/app/index.html).

To run it locally and as long as there is no distributed app or extra run script, you just open the file `app/index.html` in your browser.

## Contributing: Getting started

 - install the dependencies for the build task (1)
 - run the the build task (2)
 - run the app (3)

 ### 1: installing dependecies

 I think this can be done from project directory via terminal with:
 ```
 npm install --only=dev
 ```
 It should create a folder _node_modules_ with the packages listed in _package.json_.

 ### 2: run the build task

 Run ```gulp``` in the terminal to trigger the _gulp default_ task. An IDE like Webstorm shows these tasks usually on the left. You can also run the _default_ task from there.

  The folder **app** will be created/overridden with all compiled files from **src_app**.

 ### 3: run the app
 run `app/index.html` in your browser. Preferrably with a webserver - an IDE like AptanaStudio or WebStorm can do that, if you don't want to setup a webserver manually.
