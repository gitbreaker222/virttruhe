# VIRTTRUHE
## Experimental game to explore the border between physical and virtual space. A playground for augmented reality (or maybe augmented virtuality)

![Logo](https://github.com/gitbreaker222/virttruhe/blob/master/concept/logo/Icon.png?raw=true)

This repository is in sequel to the old ["VIRTTRUHE HTML5 App"](https://github.com/gitbreaker222/virttruhe_html5_app), to give it a clean start and making it more scalable.

## Starting the app

[Click here to view the online demo](https://rawgit.com/gitbreaker222/virttruhe/master/app/index.html).

To run it locally and as long as there is no distributed app or extra run script, you just open the file `app/index.html` in your browser.

## Contributing: Getting started

 - install the development dependencies (1)
 - run the the build task (2)
 - run the app (3)

 ### 1: installing dependecies

 First please make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com) for version commits installed and [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), to run "serverside javascrip" programs on your machine. They are used for the build tasks.

 When you have this, you can use your favourite [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) to _clone_ from `https://github.com/gitbreaker222/virttruhe.git` into your development folder. A folder _virttruhe_ will be created.

 Next you install the development dependencies into this folder. Therefor you need to open a terminal window and enter the enter the nodeJS command:
 ```
 npm install --only=dev
 ```
 It automatically downloads all packages listed in the file _package.json_ into a new folder _node_modules_.

 ### 2: run the build task

 NodeJS has now installed the task runner _gulp_ from the _node package manager (npm)_ for you.

 Run ```gulp``` in the terminal to trigger the _gulp default_ task. An IDE like Webstorm shows these tasks usually on the left. You can also run the _default_ task from there.

  The folder **app** will be created/overridden with all compiled files from **src_app**.

 ### 3: run the app
 run `app/index.html` in your browser. Preferrably with a webserver - an IDE like AptanaStudio or WebStorm can do that, if you don't want to setup a webserver manually.

 Congratulation! You are now familiar with the technology to work on modern web applications :) 🍻
